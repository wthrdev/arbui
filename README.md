# Another Restic Backup User Interface

Just like the name says, it's a tool for managing restic with pretty interface. All with terminal interface, so it's also cross-platform.

This application uses [textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) library for TUI rendering, make sure you're using latest python version.
